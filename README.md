I am a UC Presidentâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Davis. I am doing research in evolution, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence, as well mentoring and teaching. I am interested in the food insecurity, modeling of genomic evolution, as well as the evolution and domestication of plants, and human disease. I have a B.S in Computer Science and a PhD in Population Genomics.
