# Welcome to my page!

I am interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Biology for the betterment of our species.
My research focuses on <strong><em>"Forging a Sustainable Future: Harnessing Bioinformatics and AI to Ensure Food Security and Species Rescue in the Face of a Changing Climate"</em></strong>

I am a UC Presidentâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellow currently teaching at UC San Diego in the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I am doing research in evolution, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence, as well mentoring and teaching. I am interested in the food insecurity, modeling of genomic evolution, as well as the evolution and domestication of plants, and human disease. I have a B.S in Computer Science and a PhD in Population Genomics.
