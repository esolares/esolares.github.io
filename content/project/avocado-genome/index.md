## Overview

We assembled the first comprehensive reference genome for avocado (*Persea americana*), revealing the complex domestication history and genetic basis of economically important traits in this increasingly significant crop.

**Publication:** *G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics* (2023)

## Key Contributions

- **High-quality genome assembly** using long-read sequencing
- **Comparative genomics** across avocado varieties
- **Domestication analysis** revealing selection signatures
- **Trait mapping** for fruit quality and disease resistance

## Impact

Provides essential genomic resources for:
- Breeding programs targeting improved varieties
- Understanding avocado evolution and adaptation
- Developing climate-resilient cultivars

## Data Availability

Genome assembly and annotations available through NCBI.
