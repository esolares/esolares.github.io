## Overview

We investigated the domestication history of avocado (*Persea americana*) and identified potential genetic contributors to heterodichogamy - the fascinating synchronized daily alternation between male and female flower phases unique to avocado.

**Funding:** Collaborator USDA NIFA grant + UC President's Postdoctoral Fellowship (salary and sequencing costs)
**Role:** First author (G3 2023), Co-author (bioRxiv 2025)

**Publications:**
- *G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics* (2023) - "Insights into the domestication of avocado and potential genetic contributors to heterodichogamy" (First author)
- *bioRxiv* (2025) - "Balanced polymorphism in a floral transcription factor underlies an ancient rhythm of daily sex alternation in avocado" (Co-author)
