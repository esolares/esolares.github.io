## Overview

We investigated the domestication history of avocado (*Persea americana*) and identified potential genetic contributors to heterodichogamy - the fascinating synchronized daily alternation between male and female flower phases unique to avocado.

**Publications:**
- *G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics* (2023) - "Insights into the domestication of avocado and potential genetic contributors to heterodichogamy"
- *bioRxiv* (2025) - "Balanced polymorphism in a floral transcription factor underlies an ancient rhythm of daily sex alternation in avocado"

**Role:** First author

## Key Contributions

- **Domestication analysis** revealing avocado's complex evolutionary history
- **Heterodichogamy genetics** - first identification of genetic contributors to this unique flowering behavior
- **Genomic resources** for avocado breeding and improvement

## Impact

Provides essential genomic resources for:
- Breeding programs targeting improved varieties
- Understanding avocado's unique reproductive biology
- Developing climate-resilient cultivars

## Press Coverage
