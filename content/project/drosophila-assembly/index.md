## Innovation

Traditional approaches required $10,000-50,000 per genome. Our method:
- Combines short and long-read sequencing strategically
- Optimizes coverage depths for cost-efficiency
- Maintains assembly quality metrics

## Impact

- Enabled large-scale population genomics studies
- Made genome assembly accessible to smaller labs
- Methodology adopted by research groups worldwide
- Foundational for subsequent comparative genomics work
