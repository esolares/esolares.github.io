## Overview

We developed a revolutionary approach to *Drosophila melanogaster* genome assembly that reduces costs by approximately 90% while maintaining high quality, democratizing genomics research for labs worldwide.

**Publication:** *G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics* (2018)
**Role:** Co-first author

## Innovation

Traditional approaches required $10,000-50,000 per genome. Our method:
- Uses low-coverage, long-read sequencing strategically
- Optimizes coverage depths for cost-efficiency
- Maintains high assembly quality metrics
- Demonstrates feasibility with minimal sequencing data

## Impact

- **90% cost reduction** compared to traditional methods
- Enabled large-scale population genomics studies
- Made genome assembly accessible to smaller labs
- Methodology adopted by research groups worldwide
- Foundational for subsequent comparative genomics work
