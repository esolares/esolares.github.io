## Overview

This project develops artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to revolutionize sex determination in sturgeon aquaculture, dramatically reducing costs and improving sustainability of caviar production.

**Funding:** ~$465,000 USDA NIFA Western Regional Aquaculture Center (2024-2027) - Active
**Role:** Principal Investigator

## The Problem

Sturgeon aquaculture faces a critical challenge: females (caviar producers) cannot be reliably distinguished from males until 7-10 years of age, leading to massive resource waste and economic inefficiency.

## Our Approach

- **AI-Based Computer Vision**: Non-invasive imaging with deep learning models
- **Genomic Markers**: Sex-specific DNA sequence identification
- **Automation & Integration**: Scalable deployment across facilities

## Progress

- Achieved **90%+ accuracy** in preliminary sex classification models (improved from initial 76%)
- Developing robust pipelines for real-world aquaculture deployment
- Building partnerships with sturgeon farms in California and Idaho

## Collaborators

- UC Davis (Department of Animal Sciences, Dr. Jackson Gross)
- University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratories (Dr. Adam Summers)
- Industry partners: Sturgeon growers in California and Idaho

## Expected Impact

- Reduce operational costs by 30-50% through early sex identification
- Lower environmental footprint of caviar production
- Open-source framework for broader aquaculture applications
- Contribute to sustainable food production

## Press Coverage

Featured in **SDSC**, **ACCESS-CI**, **SeafoodSource**, and **Hatchery International** (2025).
