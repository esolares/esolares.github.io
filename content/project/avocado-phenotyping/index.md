## Overview

This project develops automated phenotyping systems using computer vision and machine learning to accelerate breeding programs for perennial food crops, with a focus on avocado.

**Funding:** ~$86,000 USDA NIFA subaward (2023-2024)
**Role:** Co-Investigator

## The Problem

Traditional phenotyping of perennial crops like avocado is labor-intensive and time-consuming, limiting the scale and speed of breeding programs needed to develop climate-resilient varieties.

## Our Approach

- **Computer Vision**: Automated image analysis for trait extraction
- **High-Throughput Phenotyping**: Scalable data collection pipelines
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trait prediction and selection optimization
- **Integration**: Connecting phenotypic data with breeding decision-support systems

## Key Outcomes

- High-throughput phenotyping using computer vision
- Automated data collection and analysis pipelines
- Machine learning models for trait prediction
- Integration with breeding program workflows

## Impact

Accelerating selection cycles and improving precision in trait evaluation for perennial crop breeding, supporting the development of climate-resilient avocado varieties.
