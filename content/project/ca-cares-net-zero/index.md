## Overview

Reaching a sustainable and climate-resilient future by deploying net-zero distributed computing and ecological monitoring systems. This project develops hardware and software solutions for off-grid environmental data collection and analysis.

**Status:** Prototyping phase
**Funding:** UC San Diego CA CARES (Climate Action, Resilience, and Environmental Sustainability) grant (completed)
**Lab:** Lu'um AI Labs

## Key Components

### Data Terrarium
Solar-powered edge computing device capable of running robust computing tasks entirely on renewable energy.

### Eco Data Collectors
Off-grid environmental sensors that reliably gather and transmit ecological data while operating independently of the power grid.

## Validated Functionality

- Data Terrarium can run robust computing tasks on solar power
- Eco Data Collectors reliably gather and transmit environmental data while operating off-grid

## Current Development

- Expanding and refining system durability
- Testing multisystem deployment scenarios
- Testing network scalability
- Improving LLM-based data science capabilities

## Impact

This technology enables environmental monitoring in remote locations without access to traditional power infrastructure, supporting climate research and conservation efforts in underserved regions.
