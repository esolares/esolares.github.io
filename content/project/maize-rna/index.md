## Overview

We discovered novel miRNA-like secondary structures in maize (*Zea mays*) genes and transposable elements that correlate with small RNA production, DNA methylation patterns, and gene expression levels.

**Publication:** *Genome Research* (2023)
**Featured:** SDSC & ACCESS-CI research highlights

## Key Findings

- RNA structures strongly associated with siRNA production
- Structures explain up to 27% of variation in siRNA production
- Discovered new class of tiny RNAs with regulatory potential

## Impact

First comprehensive demonstration that RNA structure plays a functional role in triggering gene silencing in plants, providing new targets for crop improvement.
