Our paper **"Insights into the domestication of avocado and potential genetic contributors to heterodichogamy"** was published in *G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics*.

## Key Achievement

Created first comprehensive reference genome for Gwen avocado cultivar with:
- N50 of 3.37 megabases
- BUSCO score of 91%
- 12 pseudo-chromosomes containing 49,450 genes

## Key Finding

The commercially dominant Hass avocado variety originated from Guatemalan ancestry, with evidence for three separate domestication events over 1 million years ago.
