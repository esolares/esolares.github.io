Our paper **"Diverse patterns of secondary structure across genes and transposable elements are associated with siRNA production and epigenetic fate"** was published as open-access in *Genome Research*.

## The Discovery

We discovered novel miRNA-like secondary structures in maize (*Zea mays*) genes and transposable elements that correlate with small RNA production, DNA methylation patterns, and gene expression levels.

## Key Findings

- RNA structures strongly associated with siRNA production
- Structures explain up to 27% of variation in siRNA production across transposable element families
- Discovered new class of tiny RNAs in maize genes with regulatory potential
