Our research on AI-assisted sex determination in white sturgeon was featured in multiple news outlets:

- **[San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu/)**: "New AI Technology Aims to Revolutionize Fish Farming"
- **[ACCESS-CI](https://access-ci.org/)**: National research highlight
- **[SeafoodSource](https://www.seafoodsource.com/)**: Industry coverage
- **[Hatchery International](https://www.hatcheryinternational.com/)**: Global aquaculture news

**Achievement:** Our AI model accuracy improved from 76% to 90% for sex determination, with plans to expand the dataset from hundreds to tens of thousands of images.

> "Thanks to funding from the USDA NIFA and U.S. National Science Foundation, we will be able to create advanced machine learning models using Expanse at SDSC to analyze these images to distinguish between male and female fish, with increasing accuracy over time."
