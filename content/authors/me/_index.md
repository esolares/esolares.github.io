## About Me

I am a Lecturer in Computer Science & Engineering and the Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. My research focuses on **harnessing AI and bioinformatics to ensure food security and species conservation** in the face of climate change.

I leverage machine learning, computer vision, and high-performance computing to analyze large-scale genomic datasets and develop predictive models for agriculture and conservation. My work has been featured in publications including *Genome Research*, *G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics*, and *PNAS*, with over 528 citations.

**Current Projects:**
- **AI-Assisted Sturgeon Sex Determination** ($465K active grant): Developing computer vision models to revolutionize sustainable aquaculture
- **Maize RNA Secondary Structures**: Discovering novel regulatory mechanisms in crop genomes using supercomputing simulations
- **Avocado Domestication Genomics**: Creating reference genomes and understanding crop evolution

I am passionate about **open science**, **diversity in STEM**, and **mentoring the next generation** of computational biologists. As a first-generation college graduate and UC President's Fellow, I am committed to creating inclusive pathways for underrepresented students in data science and computational biology.
