HapSolo is a computational tool that uses optimization approaches to identify and remove secondary haplotigs from diploid genome assemblies, improving assembly quality and contiguity.

## Key Features

- Optimization-based approach for haplotig identification
- Improves genome assembly quality
- Applicable to diverse diploid organisms
- Presented at Vertebrate Genome Project (Invited Speaker, 2020)

## Impact

This methodology has been adopted by genome assembly projects worldwide for improving the quality of diploid genome assemblies.
