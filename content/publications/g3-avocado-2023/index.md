This first-author publication in **G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics** provides essential genomic resources for understanding avocado domestication and the fascinating phenomenon of heterodichogamy - the synchronized daily alternation between male and female flower phases.

**Key Contributions:**
- Comprehensive analysis of avocado domestication history
- Identification of genetic contributors to heterodichogamy
- Genomic resources for avocado breeding programs
