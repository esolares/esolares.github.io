abstract: "This study investigates the genetic basis of sexually dimorphic UV color vision in Heliconius butterflies, revealing how sex-linked gene traffic contributes to the evolution of visual systems. We demonstrate that gene movement between autosomes and sex chromosomes underlies the acquisition of this sexually dimorphic trait."

summary: "Research on sexually dimorphic UV color vision in butterflies revealing evolutionary genetics of visual systems. Published in PNAS (Impact Factor ~12)."
