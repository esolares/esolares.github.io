abstract: "This study reveals that a balanced polymorphism in a floral transcription factor underlies the ancient rhythm of daily sex alternation (heterodichogamy) in avocado. This work provides molecular insights into one of the most fascinating reproductive strategies in flowering plants."

summary: "Discovery of the molecular basis for daily sex alternation in avocado flowers, revealing ancient balanced polymorphism in a key transcription factor."

This exciting preprint reveals the molecular mechanism behind one of nature's most intriguing reproductive strategies - the daily alternation between male and female flower phases in avocado. This builds on our earlier work on avocado domestication.
