abstract: "Structural variants (SVs) are a largely unexplored source of genetic variation in plants. Here, we analyse 50 genomes of wild and cultivated grapevines to characterize SV diversity and its consequences. Our analyses support a reduction in the proportion of deleterious protein-coding SVs during domestication, which suggests a history of selection against deleterious structural changes. We examine the population genetics of SVs across genes and non-coding regions and find that grapevine SV diversity is shaped by demography, purifying selection and positive selection."

summary: "Comprehensive study of structural variant diversity across 50 grapevine genomes revealing selection pressures during domestication. Published in Nature Plants (Impact Factor ~15)."

This landmark study in **Nature Plants** (Impact Factor ~15) represents one of the most comprehensive analyses of structural variant diversity in crop plants. The work revealed how domestication has shaped the landscape of structural genetic variation in grapevine, providing insights applicable to crop improvement efforts worldwide.
