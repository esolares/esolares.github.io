        My research focuses on **harnessing AI and bioinformatics to ensure food security and species conservation** in the face of climate change.

        I leverage machine learning, computer vision, and high-performance computing to analyze large-scale genomic datasets and develop predictive models for agriculture and conservation. My work spans five key areas:

        - **AI for Climate-Resilient Agriculture** - Developing ML tools for crop improvement and sustainable farming
        - **Evolutionary Genomics** - Understanding adaptation through comparative and population genomics
        - **RNA Biology & Epigenomics** - Discovering regulatory mechanisms in plant genomes
        - **Conservation Genomics** - AI-assisted approaches for species rescue and aquaculture
        - **Open-Source Tools** - Democratizing bioinformatics for the research community
