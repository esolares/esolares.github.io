bio: |
  I am a computational biologist and data scientist bridging artificial intelligence,
  evolutionary genomics, and climate-resilient agriculture. My research leverages
  cutting-edge machine learning and bioinformatics to address global food security
  challenges in the face of rapid climate change. With publications in high-impact
  journals including Nature Plants, PNAS, and Genome Research (h-index: 7), I develop
  tools and methods that advance both computational science and real-world applications.
